How to Play:

1.The game starts with you and the dealer each receiving two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.

2.Your goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21.

3.You can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).

4.If your hand value exceeds 21, you lose (bust).

5.If you decide to stand, the dealer will reveal their facedown card.

6.The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17, at which point they will stand.

7.The winner is determined based on the highest hand value without going over 21.

The deck is unlimited in size.

There are no jokers. 

The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.

The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.

Use the following list as the deck of cards:

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.

Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
